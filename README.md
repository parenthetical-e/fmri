# fmri

An _ad hoc_ mixture of things from the `catreward` project. 

It was the working repo for the original analysis, and could badly use better organization. 

Even the repo title `fmri` is misleading, because...

It includes:
- Behavoiral data 
- RL model fit data for the behavoiral data
- Loading functions for both data and models
- fMRI preprocessing functions
- Model-based fMRI analysis functions
- Some misc plotting functions for data visualization in `R`
- And who knows what else....
